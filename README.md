# Pushover for Google Chrome

Very simple Chrome -> Pushover extension, with your own key and token :)

If some text is selected on page, then that selection is sent as message
and address as an additional url. If not, current address is the message.

Get it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pushover-for-google-chrom/oahkmlimeakfgbphhacanjhedadnkojo)
